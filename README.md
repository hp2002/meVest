## Inspiration
As I was brainstorming an idea for the topic, I remembered a blockage me and my friends faced in high school. I always needed someone to be accountable so that I can finish
my tasks. If there was a way I can take a habit tracker seriously, it would be of great help for people facing issues with addictions and sticking to habits. This is how meVest was
created where you invest in yourself so you thrive with your own discipline!

## What it does
meVest is an app that allows the user to invest in yourself. The user decides a goal they want to achieve, addiction you want to overcome or a habit they want to build.
Next, the user decides any amount they want to meVest. The higher the amount meVested, the higher the losses for every day missed. The app can be used without investments too for people
who just want to use a habit tracker. Its simple design makes the app very user friendly. After investment, the user has to be self accountable and religously follow their goals. After 
the end of every month, the user gets the leftover balance and your progress starts over again!

## How I built it
I build meVest using JavaScript withthe React framework. I used bootstrap and CSS to improve the UI and give it a minimalistic look. For version control, GitHub was used. Before 
starting the development, I engineered the requirements and case diagrams followed by designing the layout.

## Challenges we ran into
Some of the main challenges I ran into include:
  - meVest cannot identify if the user's feedback is honest. The challenge turned out to be more of a feature as one of the motives of the app include self accountability and discipline. If 
    there is anyone who can help you achieve your goals the best would be you!
  - Using large paid APIs like Stripe cannot be implemented thus I decided to use the prompt feature for the Minimum Viable Product.
  - More resources could be provided for the user.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Here are some of my achievements that i'm proud of:
  - I managed to learn React at a really fast rate
  - I rarely attend hackathons alone but this year I went out of my comfort zone to work alone
  - UI/UX Design of the app was done entirely by me, which I find the hardest in the process of application making

## What we learned
Here are some things I learnt throughtout the journey
  - As I was the only team-member, I had to take all the work on myself which was difficult and taught me a lot about time management and efficiency.
  - I learnt a lot about colour palettes and UI/UX design.
  - CalgaryHacks hosted seminars where they taught about doodling and unfogged Tech Interviews for me.
## What's next for meVest
Here are some of the plans for the future of this app
  - meVest can give back the lost money after a 7 day streak
  - Sponsors can reward coupons and other benefits for successully completing their goals every month.
  - Friends can be added to overlook your progress, encourage you and keep you accountable
  - Widgets like Pomodoro timer, Reminders, Calendar integration, etc. can be added
